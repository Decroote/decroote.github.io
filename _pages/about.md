I am an upstate New Yorker now residing in New York City. I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree at Brown University in 2016, my Ph.D. at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in 2021, and am now an Assistant Professor at Mount Sinai. I currently teach a high school biomedical science enrichment course through the Center for Excellence in Youth Education and organize K-12 outreach efforts for the Friedman Brain Insitute. I am very passionate about introducing neuroscience curriculum into New York City schools and creating opportunities for students to gain experience working in laboratories.
