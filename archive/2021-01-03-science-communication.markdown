### Blog Editor, BraiNY: Greater NYC Chapter of the Society for Neuroscience

Outside of Mount Sinai, I also work with BraiNY, the Greater NYC Chapter of the Society for Neuroscienceâ€™s outreach group. The goal of BraiNY is to raise awareness and create opportunities for our local and global communities to engage in brain science. As a part of this cross institution team, I have organized booths for the World Science Festival: City of Science events. These events are held in a different borough each month and bring families together for a fun day of science. Beginning in 2021, I took on the role of managing the BraiNY website and blog. I now work with authors to select topics to write about and craft their articles.

### Podcast Producer, Journey through the MiND: Exploring the Life of a Neuroscientist

I was awarded a Dana Foundation Brain Awareness Week Outreach Grant to produce a podcast portraying the lives of scientists through tales of scientific experiments. In this episode I talk with Dr. Daniela Schiller, a Professor of Neuroscience and Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, about her experience breaking into a new field of research. Fueled by unwavering curiosity, she expanded from studying emotional learning early in her career to exploring the inner workings of the social brain when she founded her laboratory. In this conversation, she highlights the variety of individuals that excel in academia and the unique intersection between art and science.
