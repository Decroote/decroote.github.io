I am the Instructor for the Center for Excellence in Youth Educationâ€™s Lloyd Sherman Biomedical Science Enrichment Program. This two-year science research program is designed to help high school juniors and seniors develop a scientist identity and skillset. With the junior class, I teach an introductory biomedical science course with units on cellular, molecular, and systems biology. We also learn basic laboratory techniques, including pipetting, gel electrophoresis, spectrophotometry, gram staining, bacterial culture, and transformation etc. As seniors, students intern in research laboratories at Mount Sinai and take a senior seminar course that I also teach. This course focuses on communicating science to the research community through posters, talks, and manuscripts, but also more broadly through blogs, podcasts, and stories.
