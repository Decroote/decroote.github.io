I have worked in many labs throughout my undergraduate and graduate career, mostly in the neuroscience and mental health realms, but I ultimately focused on studying time perception for my PhD. I think time is interesting because we cannot see it, hear it, touch it, or sense it directly; yet it plays a large role in several of our cognitive processes. My research in the Schiller Lab of Affective Neuroscience demonstrated that internal representations of time guide our decisions, where we tend to behave more impatiently when events in the future feel further away. My work also showed that the hippocampus, a region historically known for its role in memory formation, also plays a crucial role in tracking temporal distances.
