I co-direct Mount Sinaiâ€™s Summer Research Program for Science Teachers, a program that provides NYC science teachers with hands-on research experience in Mount Sinai laboratories. Teachers in the program spend two consecutive summers interning in a laboratory and immersing themselves in the research enterprise by attending lab meetings, department seminars, and internal conferences. The program also includes professional development workshops, led by scientists across several NYC academic institutions, and culminates in a symposium where teachers present their research in poster and short talk formats.
