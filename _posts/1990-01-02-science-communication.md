I am passionate about storytelling as a means of communicating science. I currently serve on the organizing committee of the Friedman Brain Instituteâ€™s Stories of Brain and Beyond, a storytelling workshop run in collaboration with The Story Collider. Previously, I served as Editor of the BraiNY Blog where I worked with high school authors through postdoctoral fellows on 20+ blog articles.
