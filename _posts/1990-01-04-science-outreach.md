I direct Mentoring in Neuroscience Discovery at Sinai (MiNDS), a graduate student and faculty run volunteer group based out of the Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai. We work to bring engaging neuroscience education to NYC K-12 students through classroom courses, after-school clubs, brain fairs, brain dissections, and online educational content. Our programs provide scientists with opportunities to hone their science communication skills and aim to cultivate meaningful connections between the biomedical research community and NYC public school students. Overall, we hope our efforts reduce the barrier of entry into STEM fields and inspire the next generation of scientists.
